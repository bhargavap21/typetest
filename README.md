# typetest
TypeTest is a simple and informative typing website. It helps users analyze and improve their typing speeds. It mainly provides a quick way for users to take a short 30-second or 1-minute type test and receive stasis on their typing performance.

PHASE 1 - Web Development: Develop the user interface for the typing test, which would include a text box for users to type in and a timer to track how long the test takes. You can use HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end development.

Text Box: A text box where users can type in their test. You can use an HTML <textarea> element or a <div> element with the contentEditable attribute set to true to create the text box.

Timer: A timer that tracks how long the test takes. You can use JavaScript to create a timer that starts when the user begins typing and stops when they finish the test. The timer can be displayed on the page using an HTML <div> element or a <p> element.

Start/Stop Buttons: Buttons that allow users to start and stop the test. These can be simple HTML <button> elements that are controlled by JavaScript.

WPM/Accuracy Display: A display that shows the user's WPM and accuracy as they type. This can be done using JavaScript and can be displayed on the page using an HTML <div> element or a <p> element.

Styling: Add styling to the website using CSS to make it visually appealing and easy to use.

Client-side Validation: Implement client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure that the user has entered all required fields before submitting the test and also validate the input while they are typing.

Responsive Design: Make sure that the website is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes and devices.
